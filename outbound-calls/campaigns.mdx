An outbound "campaign" determines when, how, and to whom calls are made. Campaigns automate calls to multiple leads using your AI assistant with intelligent scheduling and retry logic.

## Quick Setup

1. **Go to Outbound / Campaigns** in your dashboard
2. **Click "Create New Campaign"**:
   - **Name**: e.g. "January Promo," "Payment Reminder," etc.
   - **Assistant**: which AI assistant will handle these calls?
   - **Schedule**: choose time windows and allowed days

## Lead Import Options

- **CSV File**: Upload phone numbers (plus any extra columns, like name or account number)
- **Google Sheets**: Connect via the no-code platform or direct integration to pull leads
- **CRM Integration**: HubSpot, GoHighLevel, etc. can send leads directly via API or automation

## Key Settings

**Call Retries & Scheduling:**
- **Max Retries**: e.g., attempt each lead up to 2 times if they don't answer
- **Retry Interval**: minutes/hours between retries
- **Time Window**: e.g., only call between 9 AM and 6 PM local time to avoid inconveniencing leads

**Monitoring & Control:**
- Once live, calls happen automatically during allowed hours
- You can **pause** or **stop** the campaign anytime to revise your script or leads list
- **Campaign Reports** show call results, answer rates, and duration analytics

## Best Practices

- **Conservative scheduling**: Business hours, respect time zones
- **Start with 2-3 retries**: Monitor and adjust based on feedback
- **Clean lead data**: Valid numbers, remove duplicates
- **Monitor costs**: Large campaigns can run thousands of parallel calls

<Note>
**Large campaigns** with thousands of leads can run concurrently, as AI can handle parallel calls. Watch your minute usage to avoid unexpected costs.
