Quick solutions for common campaign problems and performance optimization tips.

## Campaign Won't Start

### Phone Number Not Configured
**Error:** "Your agent does not have a phone number setup"

**Solution:**
1. Go to your [Assistant Settings](/ai-assistants/settings/general#phone-number-configuration)
2. Configure a phone number (Platform number, SIP, or Caller ID)
3. Save assistant settings
4. Try starting campaign again

### Insufficient Balance
**Error:** "Insufficient balance to start the campaign"

**Solution:**
1. Check your account balance in billing section
2. Add funds to your account
3. Return to campaign and click start

### No Leads to Call
**Error:** "No leads to call"

**Solution:**
1. Add leads manually or import from CSV
2. Verify leads have valid phone numbers
3. Check that leads aren't all marked as completed
4. Ensure "Mark complete when no leads" setting matches your needs

## No Calls Being Made

### Outside Allowed Hours
**Issue:** Campaign shows as running but no calls happening

**Check:**
- Current time is within allowed calling hours
- Today is an allowed calling day
- Assistant timezone matches expected schedule

**Solution:** Adjust allowed hours or wait until next allowed time window

### All Leads Called
**Issue:** Campaign appears idle

**Check:**
- All primary leads have been attempted maximum times
- Secondary contacts have been tried
- Goal completion status if using goal-based retry

**Solution:** Add more leads or review retry settings

## Call Quality Issues

### High Failure Rate
**Symptoms:** Many calls marked as "Failed"

**Common causes:**
- Invalid phone numbers in lead list
- Network connectivity issues
- Carrier restrictions

**Solutions:**
1. **Clean lead data:** Remove invalid numbers
2. **Test single calls:** Try calling individual leads manually
3. **Check number format:** Ensure proper formatting (+1234567890)
4. **Contact support:** For persistent technical issues

### Low Answer Rate
**Symptoms:** Most calls go to voicemail or unanswered

**Optimization:**
1. **Adjust calling hours:** Try different time windows
2. **Review retry interval:** Space out attempts more
3. **Check lead quality:** Verify numbers are current
4. **Caller ID setup:** Ensure professional caller ID display

## Retry Logic Problems

### Too Many Retries
**Issue:** Leads complaining about excessive calls

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce max retries:** Lower from 5 to 2-3 attempts
2. **Increase retry interval:** Space calls 2-4 hours apart
3. **Disable voicemail retry:** Accept voicemail as contact
4. **Review goal variables:** Ensure proper completion tracking

### Not Enough Retries
**Issue:** Missing potential contacts with limited attempts

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase max retries:** Up to 5 attempts
2. **Enable voicemail retry:** Continue until human contact
3. **Adjust retry interval:** Try different times of day
4. **Use goal-based retry:** For high-value prospects

## Goal Completion Issues

### Goal Variable Not Working
**Issue:** Retry until goal completed not functioning

**Requirements:**
1. **Post-call variables** must be configured in assistant
2. **Boolean variable** must exist in post-call schema
3. **Variable name** must match exactly in campaign settings
4. **AI extraction** must be working properly

**Solution:** Test assistant's post-call variable extraction with manual calls

### False Goal Completion
**Issue:** Leads marked complete incorrectly

**Debugging:**
1. **Review call transcripts** for AI extraction errors
2. **Test variable definitions** with sample calls
3. **Adjust AI prompt** for clearer goal criteria
4. **Refine variable descriptions** in assistant settings

## Performance Optimization

### Slow Campaign Progress
**Causes:**
- Conservative retry intervals
- Limited allowed calling hours
- High failure rate reducing available leads

**Solutions:**
1. **Parallel processing:** Create multiple smaller campaigns
2. **Optimize timing:** Use peak answer hours
3. **Clean data:** Remove problematic numbers
4. **Increase calling window:** Extend allowed hours

### System Resource Issues
**Symptoms:** Delayed calls, processing bottlenecks

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce concurrent campaigns:** Limit active campaigns
2. **Stagger campaign starts:** Don't start multiple campaigns simultaneously
3. **Contact support:** For platform performance issues

## Lead Management Issues

### Duplicate Contacts
**Issue:** Same person called multiple times from different leads

**Prevention:**
1. **Data cleanup:** Remove duplicates before import
2. **Phone number validation:** Check for format variations
3. **Lead deduplication:** Use tools to identify duplicates

### Secondary Contact Confusion
**Issue:** Unclear which contact was reached

**Solution:**
1. **Clear naming:** Use descriptive names for secondary contacts
2. **Call notes:** Review transcripts to identify who answered
3. **Lead organization:** Group related contacts properly

## Common Error Messages

### "Campaign is already in progress"
**Solution:** Campaign is already running. Pause it first to make changes.

### "Campaign is not running"
**Solution:** Campaign is paused or stopped. Start it to resume calling.

### "Assistant timezone not set"
**Solution:** Configure timezone in assistant settings before creating campaign.

## Getting Help

### Before Contacting Support
1. **Check error messages** for specific guidance
2. **Review campaign settings** for obvious issues
3. **Test with single lead** to isolate problems
4. **Check account status** and billing
