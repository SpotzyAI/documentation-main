This guide provides solutions for common issues encountered when integrating Cal.com with your AI assistant.

## Appointment Scheduling Issues

### Missing API Key Error

**Problem:** Getting error "missing api_key or event_id for Cal.com"

**Solution:**
1. Go to [assistant settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#default-tools)
2. Navigate to **Appointment Scheduling** section
3. **Enter correct API key** from your Cal.com developer settings
4. **Enter correct event ID** from your Cal.com event URL
5. **Click Save** to apply the configuration
6. **Verify** the connection shows as active

### Connection Problems

**API Configuration Issues:**
- **Verify API key** is active and has correct permissions in Cal.com
- **Check event ID** is correct from your Cal.com event URL
- **Confirm account access** to the Cal.com account

### Event Configuration Issues

**Events not being scheduled:**
- **No required custom fields:** Ensure you haven't added any required custom fields in Cal.com event settings. Only default fields and optional phone field are supported
- **Phone field identifier:** Verify the phone field identifier is exactly "phone" (case-sensitive)
- **Event availability:** Check that your Cal.com event has proper availability configured

### Booking Failures

**Appointments not being scheduled:**
- **Email Required:** Ensure the assistant has an email defined in [assistant settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables) and the lead has an email in inbound variables or from conversation
- **Phone field setup:** Add phone field in Cal.com event settings with identifier "phone". See [Phone Number in Calendar Events](/ai-assistants/cal-com-scheduling#phone-number-in-calendar-events) for detailed setup.
- **Test with real phone calls:** Make test calls using **phone call** (not web call) to ensure proper variable transmission
- **Check time zones** - ensure correct time zone configuration in both systems
- **Review assistant logs** - check call transcripts for booking attempts
- **Verify event settings** in Cal.com for booking restrictions

### Customer Contact Issues

**Calendar invites not sent:**
- **Email variable:** Confirm `email` variable is properly set in [assistant settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables)
- **Lead email:** Verify customer email is being passed correctly when creating leads
- **Email format:** Ensure email addresses are in valid format

**Phone number not appearing in events:**
- **Phone field setup:** Verify phone field is configured in Cal.com event settings with identifier "phone". See [Phone Number in Calendar Events](/ai-assistants/cal-com-scheduling#phone-number-in-calendar-events) for setup details.
- **Test call method:** Use phone call (not web call) for testing to ensure phone variable transmission
