Spotzyai.com offers built-in "tools" that your AI assistant can use during a call. These help you shape the conversation flow and automate actions like transferring calls or scheduling appointments.

## 1. End Call Tool

- **Purpose**: Tells the AI to politely wrap up the conversation.
- **How It Works**: You can specify in the system prompt or logic, for instance: "If the user says `goodbye`, end the call."
- **Configuration**: Enable in [Prompt & Tools settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#default-tools) and define conditions in your system prompt that should trigger the end call.

## 2. Transfer Tool

- **Purpose**: Moves the caller from the AI assistant to a human agent or external phone number.
- **Use Cases**: Warm leads on a sales call, escalations on a support call, etc.
- **Configuration**: Set up in [Prompt & Tools settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#default-tools) by adding the phone number or department the call should go to, and optionally a short hold message.

## 3. Appointment Scheduler

- **Purpose**: Lets the AI check your calendar availability and book appointments automatically.
- **Available Integrations**: Cal.com and GoHighLevel calendar systems
- **Typical Flow**:
  1. AI offers scheduling.
  2. Caller selects date/time.
  3. AI confirms and sends a confirmation (using email or SMS if configured).
- **Configuration**: Set up in [Prompt & Tools settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#default-tools) with your calendar integration.

## 4. DTMF Input

- **Purpose**: Allows the AI to send keypad inputs during calls to navigate phone menus, IVR systems, and automated workflows.
- **How It Works**: The AI can press phone keypad buttons (0-9, *, #) when encountering automated systems or menu prompts.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Navigate through company phone menus
  - Enter extension numbers to reach specific departments
  - Input security codes or account numbers
  - Bypass IVR systems to reach human agents
- **Configuration**: Enable in [Prompt & Tools settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#default-tools) and include instructions in your system prompt about when to use DTMF.

## 5. No-Code Automation Platform

- **Purpose**: After calls, the AI can trigger actions in the automation platform (like updating a CRM, sending an email, or logging results in Google Sheets).
- **Configuration**: Set up triggers and actions in the [Automation Platform](/automation-platform/introduction), then link to your assistant via webhook configuration in [Post-call Actions](/ai-assistants/settings/post-call-actions#webhook-configuration).

## 6. Custom Mid-Call Tools

- **Purpose**: Create your own custom API integrations that the AI can use during calls.
- **Use Cases**: Check inventory, verify customer data, fetch real-time information, or integrate with your own systems.
- **Configuration**: Set up in [Prompt & Tools settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#custom-mid-call-tools) by defining API endpoints, parameters, and when the AI should use them.
- For detailed setup instructions and examples, see our [Custom Mid-Call Tools Guide](/ai-assistants/custom-tools).

**Note:** Tools can be combined. For instance, the AI can use a custom tool to check availability, then schedule an appointment, and finally transfer to a human agent if needed.
