Follow this page section by section to configure your assistant. Each setting includes detailed explanations and best practices to help you make the right choices.
</Note>

## Call Direction & Basic Setup

### Assistant Type
Choose whether your assistant handles **inbound** or **outbound** calls. This fundamental choice affects which other options become available.

**Inbound (Receive calls):** Handles incoming calls from customers. See [Inbound calls overview](/inbound-calls/overview).

**Outbound (Make calls):** Initiates calls to leads or customers. See [Outbound calls overview](/outbound-calls/overview).

### Assistant Name
A descriptive name to identify your assistant in the dashboard. Use something memorable that describes the assistant's purpose (e.g. "Sales Qualifier", "Support Bot", "Appointment Scheduler").

## Phone Number Configuration

Your assistant needs a phone number to operate. The available options depend on your call direction choice.

### For Outbound Assistants
You can use:
- **Platform numbers:** Numbers rented directly from our platform
- **SIP numbers:** Connect your existing VOIP/PBX system
- **Caller ID only:** Verify ownership of an existing number to display it on outbound calls

### For Inbound Assistants  
You can use:
- **Platform numbers:** Numbers rented directly from our platform
- **SIP numbers:** Connect your existing VOIP/PBX system

**Note:** Caller ID only numbers cannot handle inbound calls - they only display on outbound calls.

### Pricing & Costs
- **Platform numbers:** Monthly rental fees starting from $3.99/month. See [renting a dedicated number](/pricing/number-rentals#1-renting-a-dedicated-number) for detailed pricing.
- **SIP integration:** No monthly fee, only $0.00045/min for AI bridging. See [SIP integration pricing](/pricing/number-rentals#2-sip-integration-no-monthly-fee).
- **Caller ID:** No monthly fee, region-based per-minute rates (e.g., $0.01/min in the US). See [Caller ID pricing](/pricing/number-rentals#3-caller-id-no-monthly-fee).

See [Phone number types](/phone-numbers/types) for detailed explanations and [SIP integration guide](/provisioning/sip-trunking/sip-integration) for VOIP setup.

## Engine Type (Voice Processing Mode)

Choose how your AI processes speech and generates responses. Each mode is optimized for different use cases. See [Assistant modes](/ai-assistants/assistant-modes) for detailed comparisons.

### Pipeline Mode
Traditional Speech-to-Text → LLM → Text-to-Speech pipeline. Offers maximum control over voice selection and response generation.

**Best for:** Complex reasoning, function calling, custom voice requirements

### Speech-to-Speech Mode  
Direct speech-to-speech generation without intermediate text processing. Provides the most natural conversational flow.

**Best for:** Quick conversations, natural back-and-forth dialogue

### Dualplex Mode (Beta)
Combines fast multimodal processing with premium ElevenLabs voice output.

**Best for:** Most use cases - recommended default

## Language Configuration

### Primary Language
The main language your assistant will use for speech recognition and synthesis. This affects:
- Speech recognition accuracy
- Available voice options  
- Filler audio phrases
- Voice model selection

See [Language support](/conversation-design/language-support) for all available languages and accents.

### Secondary Languages
Additional languages your assistant can understand and speak. Useful for:
- Multilingual customer support
- International businesses
- Code-switching conversations

**Note:** The AI can detect which language the customer is speaking and respond appropriately.

## AI Voice Selection

Your assistant can choose from existing voices, clone custom voices, or request voices from the ElevenLabs library.

### Voice Options
You have three ways to get the perfect voice for your assistant:

**1. Choose from existing voices:**
- **Professional voices:** Pre-trained, high-quality options from ElevenLabs
- **Multiple accents:** Available for most languages
- **Gender options:** Male and female voices for each language
- **Tone variety:** From formal business to casual conversational

**2. Clone a custom voice:**
Create a custom voice by uploading audio samples:

**Requirements:**
- Clear, high-quality audio sample (1-5 minutes recommended)
- MP3 or WAV format
- Consistent speaking pace and tone
- Minimal background noise
- Same voice used throughout

**Process:**
1. Record yourself or a voice actor reading sample text
2. Upload the audio file in assistant settings
3. Wait for training to complete (few minutes to hours)
4. Test the cloned voice before using in production

**Use cases:**
- Brand consistency with company spokesperson
- Personal touch for customer relationships
- Matching voice to specific business persona

**3. Request from ElevenLabs library:**
You can request specific voices from the ElevenLabs public library - contact support to add them to your account. Browse the [ElevenLabs Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-library) to discover thousands of professional voices across different languages, accents, and use cases.

See [Voice selection guide](/ai-assistants/voice-selection) for detailed setup instructions.

## Timezone Configuration

### Timezone
Set the timezone your assistant operates in. This affects:
- Time-based variables in conversations
- Appointment scheduling functions
- "Current time" references in system prompts
- Timestamps in call logs and data extraction

**Important:** Choose the timezone where your business operates or where most customers are located. The assistant will use this for any time-related calculations or scheduling.

## Audio Enhancement Settings

### Ambient Sound
Optional background sound mixed under your assistant's voice to mask processing delays and create a more natural audio experience.

**Options:**
- **None:** No background sound (default)
- **Office:** Subtle office environment sounds

**Volume control:** Adjust the level of ambient sound relative to the voice. Lower values are usually better - too much background sound can interfere with speech recognition.

<Tip>
Turn off or lower volume if the assistant isn't hearing the customer clearly.
</Tip>

### Filler Audio
Short conversational phrases like "mhm", "okay", "I understand" that play during AI processing time. See [Filler audio guide](/ai-assistants/filler-audio) for full details.
