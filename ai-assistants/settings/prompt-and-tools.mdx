Configure the objective of the assistant and the tools it can use during calls.

## Knowledge Base

Give information to the assistant to use as a knowledge base when responding to customers. From website contents, documents, etc.

### Knowledge Base Selection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose Knowledge Base" icon="book-open">
    Select a knowledge base store containing relevant information for the assistant to use.
    
    **Requirements:**
    - Must be created in your [Knowledge Bases](/knowledgebases) section first
    - Shows status (Active, Processing, etc.) and description
    - Only your own knowledge bases are available
    
    <Tip>
    Create knowledge bases from website content, PDFs, or custom documents to give your assistant domain-specific information. For comprehensive setup guide including content types, processing status, website scraping, and troubleshooting, see the complete [Knowledge Base Guide](/conversation-design/knowledge-bases).
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Knowledge Base Mode" icon="brain">
    Choose how the AI will use the knowledge base.
    
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Function Call" icon="function">
        **Recommended for most cases**
        
        Uses a function call to search for information in the knowledgebase, only when needed. More accurate and efficient.
      </Card>
      
      <Card title="Prompt Injection" icon="syringe">
        **For simple use cases**
        
        Performs a search after every customer speech. More accurate but can be slower without filler audios.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    
    <Note>
    **Mode availability:** Speech-to-Speech and Dualplex modes only support Function Call mode.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Custom Mid-Call Tools

Create and assign your own custom tools that AI can use **mid-call** with the customer.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create Custom Tools" icon="plus">
    Build tools tailored to your specific business needs: API integrations, database queries, custom workflows, and external service calls.
    
    **Quick action:** Direct link to tool creation page.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Assign to Assistant" icon="link">
    Select which custom tools this assistant can use with multiple selection, search by name/description, and real-time assignment.

</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Read the [Custom Tools documentation](/ai-assistants/custom-tools) for detailed guides on creating and configuring custom tools.
</Tip>

## Default Tools

Choose built-in tools that AI can use **mid-call** with the customer.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi Call Transfer" icon="phone-arrow-right">
    Route calls to multiple destination phone numbers like different people or departments according to your flow.
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Escalation to human agents
    - Department routing
    - Specialist handoffs
    
    **Configuration options:**
    - **Standard mode:** Use regular phone numbers (e.g., +1234567890)
    - **Advanced mode:** Use SIP URI format for SIP providers (e.g., sip:+1234567890@sip-server)
    
    **For SIP integrations:**
    - Set transfer to "Advanced" mode
    - Use SIP URI format: `sip:number@sip-server`
    - Verify your SIP provider supports SIP REFER
    - Test with different URI formats if transfers fail
    
    <Note>
    **Prompt instruction:** Include in your system prompt something like "call the transfer function when the user requests to speak with someone else" to ensure the AI uses this tool appropriately.
    </Note>
    
    <Tip>
    If transfers aren't working, see our [SIP Integration troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/sip-integration#transfer-phone-call-not-working) for detailed solutions.

    - Natural conversation conclusion
    - Objective achieved
    - Customer satisfaction confirmed

    **Prompt instruction:** If the AI doesn't call the end call function automatically, include in your system prompt "call the hang_up function to close the call" when the conversation should end.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="DTMF Input" icon="hashtag">
    Easily send keypad inputs during outbound calls, enabling smooth navigation through IVR menus and automated workflows. The AI navigates using keypad buttons when calling and responding to prompts.

<Note>
Call variables are essential for personalizing AI conversations. They allow the AI to use specific customer information during calls, making interactions more relevant and effective.
</Note>

## Call Flow Configuration

### Who Speaks First?

Control whether your assistant or the customer initiates the conversation.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI Assistant" icon="robot">
    **Default behavior:** Assistant starts the conversation
    
    The AI will immediately greet the caller and begin the conversation flow as soon as the call connects.
    
    **Best for:** Most outbound scenarios, sales calls, appointment reminders
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Customer" icon="user">
    **Wait for customer:** Assistant listens first
    
    If you choose "Customer", the AI will wait for the customer to speak first before responding.
    
    **Best for:** Inbound support calls, reception scenarios, reactive assistance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Initial Message

Configure the first thing your assistant says when the call begins.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Initial Message Text" icon="message">
    Write the opening message your assistant will speak at the start of each call.
    
    **Best practices:**
    - Keep it concise and friendly
    - Introduce your company/purpose clearly
    - Set expectations for the conversation
    - Use variables for personalization (e.g., `{customer_name}`)
    
    **Example:** "Hi {customer_name}, this is Sarah from ABC Company. I'm calling to follow up on your recent inquiry about our services. Do you have a moment to chat?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Initial Audio File" icon="volume">
    **Optional:** Upload a custom audio file instead of text-to-speech
    
    **Requirements:**
    - MP3 or WAV format
    - Clear, high-quality recording
    - Professional voice and tone
    - Matches your assistant's voice if using voice cloning
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Perfect pronunciation and delivery
    - Consistent brand voice
    - Professional first impression
    - No text-to-speech latency for opening
    
    <Tip>
    This works best if the AI voice is cloned using the same voice used in the initial audio.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
See our [Initial Message guide](/ai-assistants/initial-message) for detailed best practices and examples.
</Note>
