Configure what happens after calls end - extract specific information from conversations and send it to external systems for further processing.

## Overview

Post-call actions automatically:
- Extract structured data from conversations using AI
- Send extracted variables to webhooks for automation
- Trigger workflows in connected platforms
- Update CRM records and databases
- Enable complex automation scenarios

## Post-call Variables

Define the variables that the AI will extract from the call and send to a webhook.

### Variable Configuration

Configure which information the AI should extract from each conversation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variable Definition" icon="code">
    Create variables that the AI will identify and extract from conversations.
    
    **How extraction works:**
    The AI analyzes the complete call transcript and considers your system prompt context to extract the requested variables. It understands what was discussed during the call and extracts relevant information based on your variable descriptions.
    
    **Configuration:**
    - **Name:** Variable identifier (3-16 characters, lowercase, alphanumeric)
    - **Type:** Data type for the extracted value
    - **Description:** Clear explanation so AI understands what to extract from the conversation
    
    **Variable Types:**
    - **String:** Text values (names, addresses, comments)
    - **Number:** Numeric values (quantities, prices, scores)
    - **True/False:** Boolean values (yes/no answers, objectives achieved)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Default Variables" icon="list">
    Every assistant includes these essential variables by default:
    
    **Status (True/False):** Whether the call objective was achieved or not
    
    **Summary (String):** Call summary in a few words
    
    You can add custom variables based on your specific use case.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Variable Examples" icon="lightbulb">
    Common variables for different scenarios:
    
    **Sales qualification:**
    - `budget` (Number): Customer's budget range
    - `decision_maker` (True/False): Is caller the decision maker
    - `timeline` (String): When they need the solution
    - `pain_points` (String): Main challenges mentioned
    
    **Appointment booking:**
    - `appointment_date` (String): Preferred appointment date
    - `service_type` (String): Type of service requested
    - `contact_method` (String): Preferred contact method
    
    **Support calls:**
    - `issue_type` (String): Category of the problem
    - `urgency_level` (Number): Priority score (1-10)
    - `resolution_status` (True/False): Was issue resolved
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Extraction Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How AI Extracts Variables" icon="brain">
    The AI uses sophisticated analysis to extract variables from your calls:
    
    **Data sources:**
    - **Complete call transcript:** Everything said by both the AI and the customer
    - **System prompt context:** Your assistant's objectives and instructions help guide extraction
    - **Variable descriptions:** Clear descriptions you provide for each variable
    
    **Analysis method:**
    1. AI reviews the entire conversation transcript
    2. Considers the system prompt and call objectives
    3. Identifies relevant information based on variable descriptions
    4. Extracts and formats data according to specified types
    5. Validates extracted values before sending to webhook
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best Practices

<Warning>
**Variable naming:** Use lowercase, alphanumeric characters only. No spaces or special characters except underscores.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Clear descriptions:** Write descriptions that clearly explain what the AI should look for in the conversation transcript. The more specific and context-aware, the better the extraction accuracy.
</Tip>

<Note>
**System prompt synergy:** Your variable descriptions work best when they align with your system prompt objectives. If your assistant is designed for lead qualification, your variables should reflect that purpose.
</Note>

## Webhook Configuration

Make a request to a URL that sends the extracted variables to external systems.

### Webhook Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Status" icon="check">
    **Enabled/Disabled:** Control whether webhooks are sent after calls
    
    **Default:** Disabled - Enable only when you have a webhook endpoint ready to receive data
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Webhook URL" icon="link">
    **URL endpoint:** Where to send the extracted data
    
    **Format:** Must be a valid URL

    **Example:** `https://automate.spotzyai.com/api/v1/webhooks/your-webhook-id`
    
    **Test functionality:** Built-in test feature sends sample data to verify connectivity
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Delivery Options" icon="gear">
    **Send webhook only on completed:** 
    - **Yes (Default):** Only send data for completed calls
    - **No:** Send data for all calls regardless of completion status
    
    **Include recording in webhook:**
    - **Yes (Default):** Include recording URL in the webhook payload
    - **No:** Send only extracted variables without recording link
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Webhook Payload

The webhook will receive a comprehensive JSON payload containing call details, extracted variables, and transcript. For complete API documentation, see [Post-Call Webhook API](/api-reference/webhooks/post-call-webhook).

### Testing Webhooks

<Tip>
**Test before going live:** Use the "Make test request" button to send sample data to your webhook endpoint and verify it's working correctly.
</Tip>

**Test process:**
1. Configure your variables and webhook URL
2. Save your assistant settings
3. Click "Make test request" 
4. Check your webhook endpoint receives the test data
5. Verify the payload structure matches your expectations
