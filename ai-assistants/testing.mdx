There are multiple ways to test your AI assistant, depending on whether you want to test inbound or outbound functionality and your preferred testing method.

## Web Call Testing

**Browser-based voice testing** with the "Speak with your assistant" button:

1. Go to your assistant dashboard
2. Click "Speak with your assistant" button  
3. Test voice conversation directly in your browser
4. Evaluate voice quality, response timing, and conversation flow

**Pros:**
- Instant voice testing without phone setup
- Tests voice components and timing
- Easy access from dashboard

**Cons:**
- Call transfer functionality will not work during web testing

<Warning>
**Cost Notice:** Web call testing deducts 1 minute from your account balance per minute of call for AI processing costs. This is not free testing.
</Warning>

## Phone Call Testing

**Real phone call testing** for outbound capabilities:

1. Go to your assistant's settings
2. Find the "Speak to your assistant" purple button
3. Enter your phone number
4. Click to initiate the test
5. You'll receive a call from your AI assistant immediately

## Testing Inbound Calls

**Real phone call testing** for inbound functionality:

1. Make sure you have a phone number assigned to your assistant
2. Call that number from any phone
3. Your AI assistant will answer and handle the call

## Testing Best Practices

**Start with web calls** for quick iteration:
- Test basic conversation flow and voice quality
- Verify prompt behavior and response timing
- Note: Call transfers won't work in web testing

**Move to phone calls** for comprehensive testing:
- Test all tools including call transfers
- Verify real-world call quality and timing
- Test edge cases and interruption handling

**Cost Management:**
- Both web and phone testing use account balance
- Plan your testing sessions to manage costs
- Use text-based prompt testing first when possible

**Tip:** Save your AI's phone number in your contacts to easily make inbound test calls whenever needed.
