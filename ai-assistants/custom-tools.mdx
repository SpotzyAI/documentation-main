<Note>
  Custom Mid-Call Tools let your AI assistant interact with external systems
  during calls. Whether checking inventory, verifying customer data, or fetching
  real-time information, these tools make your AI more powerful and connected.
</Note>

## Overview

Custom Mid-Call Tools enable your AI assistant to:

- Make real-time API calls during conversations
- Fetch or submit data to your systems
- Make informed decisions based on live data
- Provide accurate, up-to-date information to callers

<Card title="Key Benefits" icon="star">
  - No coding required - just configure the API endpoint and parameters - AI
  automatically knows when and how to use the tools - Real-time data access
  during calls - Seamless integration with your existing systems
</Card>

## Setting Up Your Tool

### 1. Basic Configuration

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Tool Creation">
    Navigate to **Mid call tools** and click **Create Mid-Call Tool**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Main Settings">
    Fill in the essential details:

    - **Name**: Use lowercase and underscores (e.g., `check_order_status`)
    - **Description**: Explain when and how the AI should use this tool
    - **Endpoint**: Your API URL (e.g., `https://api.yourcompany.com/orders`)
    - **Timeout**: How long to wait for responses (in seconds)
    - **Method**: Choose GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Headers">
    Common headers you might need:
    ```yaml
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer your_token
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Variable Configuration

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/mid-call-param.png" alt="Variable Configuration" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Parameters">
    These are the pieces of information your AI will collect during the call:
    
    ```yaml
    Name: order_number
    Type: string
    Description: "10-digit order number from the customer"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Validation Rules">
    Add format requirements in the description:
    
    ```yaml
    "Date in dd/mm/yyyy format"
    "Phone number without spaces"
    "Email address for confirmation"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Parameter Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="String" icon="font">
    Text values like names, addresses, or reference numbers

    ```yaml
    Type: string
    Examples: "John Doe", "123 Main St"
    ```

  </Card>

  <Card title="Number" icon="calculator">
    Numeric values like amounts, quantities, or IDs

    ```yaml
    Type: number
    Examples: 42, 99.99
    ```

  </Card>

  <Card title="true_false" icon="toggle-on">
    Boolean values for yes/no situations

    ```yaml
    Type: true_false
    Examples: true, false
    ```

  </Card>

  <Card title="Formatting Help" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Add format instructions in descriptions

    ```yaml
    "Date in dd/mm/yyyy"

## Dynamic Endpoints

<Warning>
  When using variables in your endpoint URL, make sure to enclose them in curly
  braces and use the exact parameter name.
</Warning>

You can make your endpoints dynamic using variables:

```yaml
Basic URL:
https://api.example.com/orders/status

With Variables:
https://api.example.com/orders/{order_id}/status
```

The AI will automatically replace `{order_id}` with the actual value collected during the conversation.

## Testing Made Easy

<Card title="Automatic Testing" icon="vial">
Click "Test Tool" to run a test with dummy data:
- String parameters: "test"
- Number parameters: 1
- Boolean parameters: true

You'll see the response code and body, helping you verify everything works.

## Power User Feature: Automation Platform Integration

<Note>
  Need more complex logic? Connect your tool to the automation platform for
  advanced workflows.
</Note>

For advanced integrations and complex workflows, you can combine custom tools with our [Automation Platform](/automation-platform/introduction).

Here's how to create powerful integrations:

1. In the automation platform:

   - Create a new flow
   - Add a webhook trigger
   - Build your logic (API calls, data transformation, etc.)
   - End with "Return Response"

2. In your custom tool:
   - Use the webhook URL as your endpoint
   - Add `/sync` at the end
   - Example: `https://automation.spotzyai.com/webhook/abc123/sync`

This lets you:

- Transform data before/after API calls
- Make multiple API calls in sequence
- Apply complex business logic
- Handle errors gracefully

## Real-World Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Order Lookup System" icon="magnifying-glass">
    ```yaml
    Name: check_order
    Endpoint: https://api.yourshop.com/orders/{order_number}
    Parameters:
      - Name: order_number
        Type: string
        Description: "Order reference (format: ORD-XXXXX)"
    ```

    The AI will:
    1. Ask for the order number
    2. Fetch the status
    3. Explain delivery dates and status to the customer

      - Name: date
        Type: string
        Description: "Preferred date (dd/mm/yyyy)"
    ```

    The AI will:
    1. Ask about the desired service
    2. Get preferred date
    3. Show available time slots

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customer Verification" icon="shield-check">
    ```yaml
    Name: verify_customer
    Endpoint: https://api.crm.com/verify

        Type: string
        Description: "10-digit phone number"
      - Name: email
        Type: string
        Description: "Email address for verification"
    ```

    The AI will:
    1. Collect contact details
    2. Verify against your CRM
    3. Proceed based on verification status

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Configuring Your AI

<Info>
  The AI needs clear instructions in its system prompt to effectively use your
  custom tools.
</Info>

Example prompt section:

```yaml
When to use check_order tool:
1. Customer asks about order status
2. Mentions tracking or delivery
3. Wants to know where their package is

How to use it:
1. Ask for order number if not provided
2. Verify format (ORD-XXXXX)
3. Use tool to fetch status
4. Explain results in simple terms
```

<Tip>
  Test your tools with various conversation flows to ensure the AI handles all
  scenarios smoothly. Start with simple test calls before going live.
</Tip>
