The Post-Call Webhook is automatically sent to your specified webhook URL after each call is completed. This webhook contains call details, extracted variables, transcript, and optionally the recording URL.

## Webhook Configuration

To enable post-call webhooks:
1. Configure your assistant's webhook URL in the [assistant settings](/ai-assistants/settings/post-call-actions#webhook-configuration)
2. Enable "Post call webhook" in the [assistant configuration](/ai-assistants/settings/post-call-actions#webhook-configuration)
3. Define post-call variables that the AI should extract

## Request Format

The webhook is sent as a POST request to your configured URL with the following JSON payload:
