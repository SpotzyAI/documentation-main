### Webhook Behavior

When webhook is disabled:

- The assistant will stop sending HTTP POST requests to your webhook URL
- Both `is_webhook_active` is set to `false` and `webhook_url` is set to `null`
- Any ongoing calls will complete normally, but no webhook notifications will be sent
- Call data will still be available through the API calls endpoints

### Notes

- The assistant must belong to the authenticated user
- This completely removes the webhook configuration from the assistant
- You can later re-enable webhooks using the enable webhook endpoint with a new URL
- Disabling webhooks does not affect call recording or data collection
