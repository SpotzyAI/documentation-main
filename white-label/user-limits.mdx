Manage individual user limits and restrictions beyond the default plan limits. This allows you to customize specific users' access without changing their plan.

## Overview

User limits provide granular control over individual users on your white label platform. You can override plan limits for specific users, giving them more or less access than their plan normally allows.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**User can't create resources:**
- Check current vs. limit usage
- Verify limit type (count vs. boolean)
- Confirm user is on correct plan

**Limits not applying:**
- Clear platform cache
- Verify limit configuration
- Check for conflicting settings

<Warning>
**Resource Impact:** Unlimited settings (-1) should be used carefully as they can impact platform performance and costs.
</Warning>

<Note>
User limits override plan limits. A user's effective limit is always the user limit if set, otherwise the plan limit applies.
