Create and configure automated calling campaigns to efficiently reach multiple leads with your AI assistant.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a campaign, ensure you have:
- **AI assistant** configured for outbound calls
- **Phone number** assigned to your assistant  
- **Account balance** sufficient for call costs
- **Leads ready** to import or add manually

## Campaign Setup

### 1. Basic Information

**Campaign Name:** Choose a descriptive name for easy identification
**Assistant Selection:** Select which AI assistant will make the calls

<Note>
The assistant's configuration (voice, prompt, tools) will be used for all campaign calls.
</Note>

### 2. Scheduling Configuration

#### Allowed Calling Hours
Set when your campaign can make calls:
- **Start time:** Earliest time to begin calling (default: 00:00)
- **End time:** Latest time to stop calling (default: 23:59)
- **Timezone:** Uses assistant's configured timezone

#### Allowed Days
Select which days of the week to make calls:
- **Default:** Monday through Sunday
- **Business only:** Monday through Friday
- **Custom:** Choose specific days

<Tip>
**Recommendation:** For business calls, use Monday-Friday 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM in the prospect's timezone.
</Tip>

### 3. Retry Settings

#### Basic Retry Options
- **Max retries:** 1-5 attempts for unanswered calls (default: 3)
- **Retry interval:** 10-4320 minutes between attempts (default: 60 minutes)

#### Advanced Retry Conditions

**Retry on Voicemail:**
- **Enabled:** Continue calling until human answers
- **Disabled:** Count voicemail as attempted contact

**Retry Until Goal Completed:**
- **Enabled:** Keep calling until objective is achieved
- **Goal variable:** Select boolean variable from assistant's post-call schema
- **Use case:** Sales calls, appointment booking, lead qualification

<Warning>
**Goal-based retry** requires your assistant to have post-call variables configured with boolean fields (true/false).
</Warning>

### 4. Lead Management

#### Adding Leads

**Manual Entry:**
- Add individual leads with phone numbers
- Include names and additional contact information

**CSV Import:**
- Upload spreadsheet with lead information
- Required: Phone number column
- Optional: Name, email, additional fields

**Integration Import:**
- Import from GoHighLevel, Google Sheets, or other connected platforms
- Automatic sync with external lead sources

#### Secondary Contacts
Add additional phone numbers for the same lead:
- **Use case:** Multiple decision-makers, backup contacts
- **Logic:** Campaign will try all numbers for each lead
- **Status:** Independent tracking for each contact

## Starting Your Campaign

### Pre-launch Checklist
- [ ] Assistant has phone number configured
- [ ] Sufficient account balance
- [ ] Leads added with valid phone numbers
- [ ] Schedule configured appropriately
- [ ] Retry logic matches campaign goals

### Launch Process
1. **Review settings** one final time
2. **Click "Start Campaign"** to begin
3. **Monitor progress** in campaign dashboard
4. **Adjust settings** if needed (pause campaign first)

## Campaign Monitoring

### Real-time Status
- **Calls in progress:** Currently active calls
- **Calls completed:** Finished calls with outcomes
- **Leads remaining:** Contacts still to be called
- **Next call time:** When next call will be made

### Monitoring Progress
Track lead status and call results in the campaign dashboard. See [Campaign Overview](/campaigns/index#campaign-monitoring) for detailed status explanations.

## Managing Active Campaigns

### Pausing a Campaign
- **Immediate stop:** Current call completes, no new calls start
- **Resume capability:** Can restart without losing progress
- **Use cases:** Adjust settings, review results, temporary pause

### Modifying Settings
1. **Pause the campaign** first
2. **Edit configuration** as needed
3. **Save changes**
4. **Resume campaign** to continue with new settings

### Adding More Leads
- **Add to active campaign:** New leads join existing retry queue
- **Import additional contacts:** CSV or integration import
- **Secondary contacts:** Add backup numbers for existing leads

## Best Practices

- **Conservative scheduling:** Business hours, respect time zones
- **Start with 2-3 retries:** Monitor and adjust based on feedback
- **Clean lead data:** Valid numbers, remove duplicates
- **Compliance:** Follow local regulations and opt-out requests
