Campaigns enable you to automate calls to multiple leads using your AI assistant. Set up scheduling, retry logic, and lead management to run efficient outbound calling operations.

## Key Features

### Scheduling & Timing
- **Allowed calling hours:** Set start and end times (e.g., 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM)
- **Allowed days:** Choose specific days of the week for calling
- **Timezone support:** Uses assistant's configured timezone
- **Call window validation:** System automatically respects time restrictions

### Retry System
- **Max retries:** 1-5 attempts for unanswered calls (default: 3)
- **Retry interval:** 10-4320 minutes between attempts (default: 60 minutes)
- **Retry on voicemail:** Continue calling until human answers
- **Goal-based retry:** Keep calling until objective is achieved (requires [post-call variables](/ai-assistants/settings/post-call-actions#post-call-variables) with boolean type)

### Lead Types
- **Primary leads:** Main contacts imported or added to campaign
- **Secondary contacts:** Additional contacts linked to primary leads
- **Lead status tracking:** Monitor call progress and outcomes

## Requirements

Before starting a campaign:

<Warning>
**Phone Number Required:** Your assistant must have a [phone number configured](/ai-assistants/settings/general#phone-number-configuration) for outbound calls.
</Warning>

- **Configured AI assistant** with outbound calling capability
- **Sufficient account balance** for call costs
- **Leads added** to the campaign (manual, import, or integration)
- **Valid phone numbers** for all leads

## Quick Start

1. **Create Campaign:** Choose a name and select your AI assistant
2. **Set Schedule:** Define allowed calling hours and days
3. **Configure Retries:** Set retry attempts and intervals
4. **Add Leads:** Import from CSV or add manually
5. **Start Campaign:** Click start when ready to begin calling

<Note>

</Note>

## Campaign Monitoring

### Lead Status Tracking
Monitor individual lead progress through the campaign:
- **Created:** Ready to be called
- **Scheduled:** Queued for next call attempt
- **Processing:** Currently being called
- **Completed:** Successfully contacted or goal achieved
- **Rescheduled:** Scheduled for retry attempt
- **Max Retries:** Reached maximum retry attempts

**Manual lead management:** You can change lead status in the leads table:
- **Set to "Created":** Reset lead to be called again
- **Set to "Completed":** Mark lead as finished to stop calling

### Call Results
Individual call outcomes with detailed status:
- **Initiated:** Call started
- **Ringing:** Phone is ringing
- **In Progress:** Call connected and active
- **Completed:** Call finished successfully
- **Busy:** Line was busy
- **Unanswered:** No one answered
- **Failed:** Technical issue prevented call

## Troubleshooting

**Campaign won't start:**
- Check if assistant has phone number configured
- Verify sufficient account balance
- Ensure leads are added to campaign

**No calls being made:**
- Wait 10-15 minutes after starting - campaigns take time to initialize
- Check if current time is within allowed calling hours
- Verify allowed days include current day
- Confirm leads have valid phone numbers

**Too many/few retries:**
- Adjust max retries setting (1-5 attempts)
- Modify retry interval (10-4320 minutes)
- Review retry conditions (voicemail, goal completion)

<Tip>
**Best Practice:** Start with conservative retry settings and adjust based on campaign performance and customer feedback.
