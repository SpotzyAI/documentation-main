3. **Add custom variables** for your GoHighLevel leads:
   - You'll see `customer_name` with default value "John"
   - **Add `email` variable** with a default value
   - Add any additional variables like `company_name`, `address`, etc.

4. **Variables can be used in multiple ways:**
   - **In the system prompt**: "Hi `{customer_name}`"
   - **For mid-call tools**: Personalized API calls
   - **For file imports**: Bulk lead processing
   - **For automation platform**: Dynamic data mapping

## Step 3: Set Up Post-Call Variables

Post-call variables help track the success of your calls and automate follow-up actions.

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/tutorials/gohighlevel/05-post-call-variables.png" alt="Post-call variables configuration" />
</Frame>

1. **Navigate to step 3** "Post-call Variables"
2. **Review the default variables:**
   - `status` - Boolean (true/false) indicating if call objective was achieved
   - `summary` - Text summary of the call conversation

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/tutorials/gohighlevel/06-status-variable-explanation.png" alt="Understanding the status variable" />
</Frame>

The `status` variable is crucial for campaign automation:
- **True**: Call objective achieved, lead marked as completed
- **False**: Call objective not met, lead will be retried

3. **Click "Create"** to finalize your assistant

## Step 4: Create Campaign with Retry Logic

Now we'll create a campaign that intelligently retries leads until the call objective is achieved.

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/tutorials/gohighlevel/07-create-campaign.png" alt="Creating new campaign" />

## Best Practices

### Variable Management
- **Define all necessary variables** in your assistant before creating automations
- **Use descriptive variable names** that match your GoHighLevel fields
- **Test with sample data** before going live

### Campaign Configuration
- **Start with 3 retries maximum** to avoid overwhelming leads
- **Use 60-minute intervals** to allow reasonable callback timing
- **Monitor the `status` variable** to track conversion rates

### Lead Quality
- **Ensure phone numbers are in international format** (+1234567890)
- **Verify email addresses** for follow-up automations
- **Keep lead data up to date** in GoHighLevel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Leads not being imported:**
- Check GoHighLevel connection authorization
- Verify webhook is properly configured
- Ensure new contacts have valid phone numbers

**Variables not populating:**
- Confirm variable names match between assistant and automation
- Check that GoHighLevel fields contain data
- Verify mapping in the automation step

**Calls not triggering:**
- Ensure campaign is started
- Check phone number configuration
- Verify assistant is properly configured

## Next Steps

Once your basic automation is working:
- **Set up SMS follow-ups** for unsuccessful calls
- **Create Google Sheets integration** to track qualified leads
- **Add email automation** for additional touchpoints
- **Monitor and optimize** your conversion rates

Your GoHighLevel leads will now be automatically called by your AI assistant with intelligent retry logic until your call objectives are achieved!
