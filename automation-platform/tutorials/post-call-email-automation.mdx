1. **Navigate to Automation Platform**
2. **Create a new flow** from scratch
3. **Search for your calling platform** in triggers
4. **Select "Phone Call Ended"** trigger
   - This captures data from all completed calls to your selected assistant

## Step 2: Configure Assistant and Webhook Integration

<video

  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/03-select-assistant-for-email.mp4"></video>

1. **Select your target assistant**
   - Each assistant supports only one post-call automation
   - All calls to this assistant will trigger this email flow
2. **Click "Test Trigger"** to set up the webhook
   - This automatically generates and saves a webhook URL
   - The webhook is stored in your assistant's post-call settings

## Step 3: Verify Assistant Configuration

<video

  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/05-check-assistant-webhook.mp4"></video>

1. **Open your assistant** in a new tab
2. **Navigate to "Post-call Actions"** (third tab)
3. **Confirm webhook URL** was automatically configured

</Frame>

4. **Review trigger settings:**
   - **Enabled**: Automation triggers after calls
   - **Completed calls only**: Recommended for email follow-ups
   - **All calls**: Select "No" to include failed calls

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/07-post-call-variables.png" alt="Post-call variables for email content" />
</Frame>

5. **Verify post-call variables:**
   - **status**: Boolean indicating call success
   - **email**: Customer email (ensure this is collected during calls)

## Step 4: Ensure Email Collection

For email automation to work, your assistant must collect customer email addresses.

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/08-set-test-values.png" alt="Call variables including email collection" />
</Frame>

1. **Check your assistant's call variables:**
   - Ensure `email` variable is defined
   - Set default test email for testing purposes. **Use your real email address** for testing.
   - Consider making email collection part of your call script

## Step 5: Generate Test Call with Email Data

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/09-make-test-call.mp4"></video>

1. **Make a test call to generate webhook data:**
   - Click **"Speak to Assistant"** → **"Phone Call"**
   - **Answer when your assistant calls you**
   - **Respond positively** to ensure the `status` variable becomes `true`
   - **Complete the call objective** during the conversation
   - **End the call naturally**

<Note>
In a real situation, the assistant will take data assigned to the lead. For testing, it uses the default values you just set.
</Note>

<video

  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/10-check-call-results.mp4"></video>

2. **Verify call results and variable extraction:**
   - **Navigate to your calls list** and find the recent call
   - **Click on the call** to view details
   - **Confirm the `status` variable is `true`** (call objective achieved)
   - These variables are extracted after each call based on:
     - Call transcript
     - Variable descriptions
     - Variable types (Boolean for status)
     - System prompt context

<Note>
The variables after a call are being extracted. You can refresh the page after about a minute and then you will see the extracted variables.
</Note>

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/11-received-call-data.mp4"></video>

1. **Return to your automation tab**
2. **Verify you received call data** from the test trigger
   - You should see the webhook data because you clicked "Test Trigger" and then made a call
   - The automation received the request after the call ended and variables were extracted

3. **Alternative method - resend webhook data from existing calls:**

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/12-resend-webhook.mp4"></video>

   - If you need to test with different call data, you can reuse any existing call
   - **Click "Test Trigger"** again in your automation
   - **Go to any completed call** in your platform  
   - **Click "Resend Webhook"** to push that call's data to your automation
   - **Return to automation tab** to see the updated data

### Adding New Post-Call Variables

<Note>
If you need to add a new post-call variable after creating the automation, follow this process to update your automation with the new variable data.
</Note>

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/add-variable.mp4"></video>

1. **Define the new variable in your assistant:**
   - Go to assistant settings → "Post-call Actions" tab
   - Add your new post-call variable (name, type, description)
   - **Save the assistant**

2. **Update automation with new variable data:**
   - **Return to your automation**
   - **Click "Test Trigger"** to prepare for new webhook data


3. **Re-evaluate an existing call:**

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/post-call-email/re-evaluate.mp4"></video>

   - **Go to any completed call** for this assistant
   - **Click "Re-evaluate"** to extract the new variable from that call
   - **Wait for processing** to complete

4. **Send updated data to automation:**
   - **Click "Resend Webhook"** on the same call
   - **Return to automation tab** 
   - **Verify the new variable** is now available in your automation data

<Tip>
This resend feature is useful for testing different scenarios without making new calls every time.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Configure Conditional Email Logic


We only want to add leads to Google Sheets when the call objective was achieved.
