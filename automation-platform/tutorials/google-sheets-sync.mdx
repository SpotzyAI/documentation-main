</Frame>

1. **Navigate to Assistants page** and click "Assistants" in the sidebar
2. **Click "New Assistant"** button
3. **Name your assistant** - we'll use "Test GoogleSheets"

4. **Complete the basic settings:**
   - Select a phone number for outbound calls
   - Choose an appropriate voice
   - Set your timezone

## Step 2: Configure Call Variables for Spreadsheet Data

Call variables will map directly to columns in your Google Sheet, so plan your spreadsheet structure accordingly.

</Frame>

1. **Go to the "Prompts and Tools" tab** (second tab)
2. **Locate the "Call Variables" section**

<video

  src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/04-add-email-variable.mp4"></video>

3. **Configure your call variables:**
   - You'll see `customer_name` with default value "John"
   - **Add `email` variable** with your email as default value for testing
   - Add any additional variables that match your spreadsheet columns

4. **Variables can be used in multiple ways:**
   - **In the system prompt**: "Hi `{customer_name}`"
   - **For mid-call tools**: Personalized API calls
   - **For file imports**: Bulk lead processing
   - **For automation platform**: Dynamic data mapping

## Step 3: Create Campaign for Sheet Leads

   - **Give it a descriptive name**
   - **Select the assistant** you just created
   - **Keep default retry settings** (can be adjusted later)

4. **Click "Create"** to save the campaign

## Step 4: Set Up Google Sheets Automation

Now we'll create the automation that monitors your Google Sheet for new leads.

5. **Create a new connection:**
   - Click "New Connection"
   - Authorize with your Google account
   - Click "Save" once connected

## Step 5: Create and Configure Your Test Spreadsheet and add sample data

For this tutorial, we'll create a properly formatted test spreadsheet.

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/11-create-new-sheet.mp4"></video>

1. **Go to Google Sheets** and create a new spreadsheet
2. **Name it "testnewleads"** (or any descriptive name)
3. **Add a test lead in the first row:**
   - **Phone number**: Use international format (+1234567890)
   - **Customer name**: Your name for testing
   - **Email**: Your email address

<Warning>
**Phone Number Format**: Always use international format with + sign and no spaces or parentheses. Example: +1234567890, not (123) 456-7890
</Warning>

2. **Save the spreadsheet** - this data will be used for testing

## Step 7: Configure the Automation Trigger

<video

  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/14-select-spreadsheet.mp4"></video>

1. **Return to the automation platform**
2. **Select your spreadsheet** ("testnewleads")
3. **Select the specific sheet** (usually "Sheet1")

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/15-load-data.mp4"></video>

4. **Click "Load Data"** to fetch the sample lead
5. **Verify** that you can see the lead data you just created

## Step 8: Configure the Campaign Action

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/16-add-action.mp4"></video>

1. **Click the "+" sign** to add an action
2. **Search for your calling platform**
3. **Select "Add Lead to Campaign"**

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/17-select-campaign.mp4"></video>

4. **Select the campaign** you created for this automation

## Step 9: Map Spreadsheet Data to Assistant Variables

This step connects your spreadsheet columns to your assistant's call variables.

<video

  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/18-map-phone-number.mp4"></video>

1. **Click on the "Phone Number" input field**
2. **A sidebar will open** showing available data from the trigger
3. **Search for and select the phone number** from your spreadsheet
4. **Click "Insert"** to map the field

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/19-map-variables.mp4"></video>

5. **Map your call variables:**
   - **customer_name**: Select from spreadsheet data
   - **email**: Select from spreadsheet data
   - Map any additional variables you defined

<Tip>
The variable names in your assistant must match the data you're mapping. If you have more columns in your spreadsheet, make sure to define corresponding variables in your assistant first. Learn more about [configuring call variables](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables).
</Tip>

## Step 10: Test the Integration

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/20-test-step.mp4"></video>

1. **Click "Test Step"** to verify the lead creation
2. **Check for success confirmation**
3. **Navigate to your Leads page** to confirm:
   - The lead appears in your platform
   - All variables are correctly populated
   - Data matches your spreadsheet entry

## Step 11: Publish and Monitor

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/tutorials/google-sheets-sync/22-publish-automation.png" alt="Publishing the automation" />
</Frame>

1. **Click "Publish"** to activate your automation
2. **Your spreadsheet is now being monitored** for new rows
3. **Test the live sync:**
   - Add new leads to your spreadsheet
   - Check that they automatically appear in your platform
   - Monitor the automation runs for any issues
4. **Monitor automation performance:**
   - Click "Runs" button in your automation
   - Review each execution for success/failure
   - Check timing and data accuracy

## Best Practices

### Spreadsheet Management
- **Maintain consistent data format** across all entries
- **Keep phone numbers in international format** consistently
- **Avoid empty rows** between data entries

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Variable Support
If your business needs more lead data:

1. **Add columns** to your spreadsheet (company_name, address, etc.)
2. **Define corresponding variables** in your assistant
3. **Map the new fields** in your automation
4. **Test with sample data** before adding real leads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Leads not syncing:**
- Check Google Sheets connection authorization
- Verify spreadsheet permissions and sharing settings
- Ensure new rows contain data in all mapped columns

**Phone number format errors:**
- Use international format: +1234567890
- Remove spaces, parentheses, and dashes
- Verify country code is included

**Variable mapping issues:**
- Confirm variable names match between assistant and spreadsheet
- Check that columns contain data
- Verify mapping configuration in automation

**Automation not triggering:**
- Ensure automation is published and active
- Check that new rows are actually being added
- Verify Google Sheets trigger is properly configured

## Next Steps

Once your Google Sheets integration is working:
- **Scale up** with larger lead lists
- **Add more variables** for better personalization
- **Integrate with other tools** like CRM systems
- **Set up follow-up automations** for call results
- **Monitor and optimize** your conversion rates

Your Google Sheet is now a powerful lead management tool that automatically triggers AI calls for every new lead you add!
