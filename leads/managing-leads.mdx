Learn how to create, edit, and manage leads effectively for your campaigns with proper variable setup and secondary contact management.

## Creating a New Lead

### Basic Information
1. **Phone Number:** Enter the primary contact number in international format
2. **Campaign Assignment:** Select which campaign this lead belongs to
3. **Status:** Automatically set to "Created" for new leads

<Note>
**Phone number format:** Use international format without spaces or parentheses (+1234567890) for automation imports and file uploads.
</Note>

### Variable Setup

#### Assistant Default Variables
When you select a campaign, the lead automatically inherits variables from the [assistant configuration](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables):
- **Pre-filled values:** Assistant's default variables appear in the form
- **Customization:** Modify values specific to this lead
- **Required fields:** Some variables may be required for campaign functionality

#### Custom Variables
Add personalized information for your AI assistant to use:

**Common variable types:**
- **customer_name:** Person's name for personalized greetings
- **company:** Business name for B2B conversations  
- **last_interaction:** Previous conversation context
- **preferences:** Customer preferences or requirements
- **budget_range:** Financial information for sales calls

**Variable format example:**
```json
{
  "customer_name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "company": "TechStart Solutions", 
  "last_interaction": "Requested demo of premium features",
  "preferred_contact_time": "Afternoon EST",
  "industry": "Software Development"
}
```

### Secondary Contacts

Add additional phone numbers for the same lead when you have multiple ways to reach them.

#### When to Use Secondary Contacts
- **Decision makers:** Multiple people involved in the decision
- **Backup numbers:** Mobile, office, home numbers for same person
- **Department contacts:** Different departments in same company
- **Time-based contacts:** Different numbers for different times

#### Secondary Contact Setup
1. **Add Secondary Contact:** Click "Add Secondary Contact" in the form
2. **Phone Number:** Enter additional phone number
3. **Variables:** Set specific variables for this contact (optional)
4. **Order:** Contacts are tried in the order you add them

<Tip>
**Contact order matters:** Campaign will try contacts in sequence. Put the most likely to answer first.
</Tip>

#### Secondary Contact Variables
Each secondary contact can have unique variables:
- **Different person:** Use different name and role variables
- **Same person:** Use same personal info but different contact preferences
- **Department-specific:** Customize for specific department needs

**Example - Multiple decision makers:**
```json
// Primary: CEO
{
  "contact_name": "John Smith",
  "role": "CEO", 
  "decision_authority": "Final approval"
}

// Secondary: CTO  
{
  "contact_name": "Jane Doe",
  "role": "CTO",
  "decision_authority": "Technical decisions"
}
```

## Editing Existing Leads

### Modifying Lead Information
- **Phone number:** Update if contact information changes
- **Campaign:** Move lead to different campaign if needed
- **Status:** Manually change status for campaign control

### Variable Management
- **Update values:** Modify existing variable values
- **Add variables:** Include new information for better AI context
- **Remove variables:** Delete outdated or irrelevant data

<Warning>
**Campaign compatibility:** When changing campaigns, ensure variables match the new assistant's configuration.
</Warning>

### Secondary Contact Management
- **Add contacts:** Include additional phone numbers
- **Remove contacts:** Delete invalid or unnecessary numbers  
- **Reorder contacts:** Change calling sequence priority
- **Update variables:** Modify contact-specific information

## Lead Status Management

### Understanding Status Changes
Lead status automatically updates based on campaign activity:
- **Created → Processing:** When campaign starts calling
- **Processing → Completed:** When call succeeds or goal achieved  
- **Processing → Rescheduled:** When call needs retry
- **Rescheduled → Max Retries:** When retry limit reached

### Manual Status Control
You can manually change lead status when needed:

#### Reset for Re-calling
**Set to "Created":** Resets lead to be called again
- **Use case:** Lead requested callback at specific time
- **Effect:** Lead rejoins campaign queue
- **Considerations:** Respects campaign retry limits

#### Mark as Complete
**Set to "Completed":** Stops campaign from calling this lead
- **Use case:** Goal achieved through other channels
- **Effect:** Lead excluded from future campaign calls
- **Considerations:** Cannot be automatically reset by campaign

#### Other Status Changes
- **"Scheduled":** Queue for next retry attempt
- **"Max Retries":** Manually mark as exhausted
- **"Rescheduled":** Reset retry timer

<Tip>
**Status strategy:** Use manual status changes sparingly. Let campaign automation handle most status updates for consistent behavior.
</Tip>

## Bulk Operations

### Bulk Delete
Select multiple leads and delete them:
1. **Filter leads:** Use table filters to select specific leads
2. **Select leads:** Check boxes for leads to delete
3. **Bulk delete:** Choose delete action from bulk actions menu
4. **Confirm:** Review changes before applying

### Bulk Export
Export filtered lead data for external processing:
- **Apply filters:** Filter by campaign, status, date range
- **Select columns:** Choose which data to export
- **Include secondary:** Option to include secondary contacts
- **Download:** CSV format for spreadsheet compatibility

## Lead Organization

Use table filters, sorting, and search to organize leads by campaign, status, date range, or variable content.

## Campaign Integration

- **Single campaign** assignment per lead
- **Variable inheritance** from assistant configuration
- **Automatic coordination** with campaign schedule and retry logic

## Best Practices

### Key Points
- **Phone format:** International format without spaces (+1234567890)
- **Variables:** Use consistent naming and relevant information
- **Secondary contacts:** Order by priority, avoid duplicates
- **Privacy:** Follow data protection requirements
