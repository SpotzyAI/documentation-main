Leads are the contacts that your campaigns will call. Each lead can have multiple phone numbers (secondary contacts) and custom variables that your AI assistant can use during conversations.

## What are Leads?

Leads represent the people or businesses you want to contact through your campaigns. The lead system supports:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Primary Contacts" icon="user">
    **Main contact** for each lead
    
    The primary phone number and contact information
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Secondary Contacts" icon="users">
    **Additional phone numbers** for the same lead
    
    Backup contacts, decision makers, or alternative numbers
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Custom Variables" icon="code">
    **Personalized information** for AI conversations
    
    Names, preferences, history, or any data your assistant needs
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Status Tracking" icon="chart-line">
    **Progress monitoring** through campaign lifecycle
    
    Track call attempts, completions, and retry status
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Lead Status System

Every lead moves through different statuses during campaign execution:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Created" icon="plus">
    **Ready to call** - Lead is queued for first contact attempt
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Scheduled" icon="calendar">
    **Queued for retry** - Scheduled for next call attempt based on campaign settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Processing" icon="phone">
    **Currently being called** - Call is in progress
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rescheduled" icon="clock">
    **Waiting for retry** - Will be called again after retry interval
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Max Retries" icon="ban">
    **Retry limit reached** - Maximum call attempts exceeded
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Completed" icon="check">
    **Successfully contacted** - Call completed or goal achieved
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Primary vs Secondary Contacts

### Primary Contacts
- **Main lead record** with complete information
- **First to be called** in campaign sequence  
- **Inherits campaign variables** from assistant settings
- **Controls overall lead status** and completion

### Secondary Contacts
- **Additional phone numbers** for the same person/business
- **Called if primary doesn't answer** (based on campaign retry settings)
- **Independent status tracking** from primary contact
- **Can have unique variables** different from primary

<Tip>
**Use case example:** A business lead might have the main office number as primary contact, with the decision maker's direct line and mobile as secondary contacts.
</Tip>

## Variables System

Variables personalize AI conversations with lead-specific information. They are inherited from [assistant configuration](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables) and can be customized per lead.

**Usage in conversations:** Assistant uses variables like `{customer_name}` and `{company}` for personalized responses.
