Import large numbers of leads from CSV or Excel files with automatic validation, background processing, and comprehensive error reporting.

## Import Process Overview

The lead import system supports:
- **CSV and Excel files** (.csv, .xlsx, .xls)
- **Background processing** for large files
- **Automatic validation** with error reporting
- **Secondary contacts** in same import
- **Variable mapping** from assistant configuration

## Preparing Your Import File

### Required Columns
Your import file must include:
- **phone_number:** Primary contact phone number (required)
- **Variables:** Columns matching your [assistant's configured variables](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables)

### Optional Columns
- **Secondary contact columns:** Additional phone numbers
- **Variable overrides:** Custom values for specific leads

### File Format Example
```csv
phone_number,customer_name,company,budget_range,secondary_phone_1,secondary_phone_2
+14155551234,John Smith,ABC Corp,10k-50k,+14155551235,+14155551236
+14155557890,Jane Doe,XYZ Inc,50k-100k,+14155557891,
+14155554567,Bob Johnson,Tech Start,5k-10k,,
```

## Campaign Selection

### Choose Target Campaign
1. **Select campaign** from dropdown during import
2. **Assistant variables** automatically determine expected columns  
3. **Variable inheritance** applies assistant defaults to all imported leads

### Variable Mapping
- **Assistant variables** become column headers in sample file
- **Default values** from assistant configuration
- **Override capability** with custom values per lead

<Note>
**Download sample file:** The import dialog provides a sample CSV with proper headers based on your selected campaign's assistant variables.

## Import Steps

### 1. Start Import Process
1. **Navigate to Leads** section or Campaign leads tab
2. **Click "Import Leads"** button  
3. **Select campaign** for lead assignment
4. **Download sample** file to see expected format

### 2. Upload File
1. **Choose file:** Select your CSV or Excel file
2. **Ignore errors option:** Enable to skip invalid rows
3. **Review settings:** Confirm campaign and options
4. **Start import:** Click "Import now" to begin

### 3. Background Processing
- **Queue processing:** Large files processed in background
- **Progress tracking:** Import status updates automatically
- **Notification:** Email notification when import completes
- **Error reporting:** Download report of any failed rows

## Validation Rules

### Phone Number Validation
- **Format checking:** International format preferred (+1234567890)
- **Duplicate detection:** Prevents duplicate phone numbers
- **Invalid numbers:** Automatically flagged and skipped

### Variable Validation
- **Required fields:** Variables marked as required must have values
- **Data types:** Text, number, boolean validation where applicable
- **Length limits:** Maximum character limits enforced

### Secondary Contact Validation
- **Phone format:** Same validation as primary numbers
- **Unique numbers:** Secondary contacts must differ from primary
- **Variable consistency:** Secondary contact variables validated independently

## Error Handling

### Skip Invalid Rows
When "Ignore errors" is enabled:
- **Valid rows imported:** Successfully validated leads added
- **Invalid rows skipped:** Problem rows excluded from import
- **Error report generated:** Download detailed report of skipped rows
- **Partial success:** Import completes with valid subset

### Common Validation Errors
- **Invalid phone numbers:** Incorrect format or impossible numbers
- **Missing required fields:** Empty values for required variables
- **Duplicate phone numbers:** Phone number already exists in system
- **File format issues:** Corrupted or unsupported file format

### Error Report Download
After import completion:
- **Download link** provided in notification
- **Detailed error descriptions** for each failed row
- **Correction guidance** for fixing issues
- **Re-import capability** with corrected data

## Secondary Contacts Import

### Multiple Phone Numbers per Lead
Include additional columns for secondary contacts:
```csv
phone_number,customer_name,secondary_phone_1,secondary_phone_2,secondary_phone_3
+14155551234,John Smith,+14155551235,+14155551236,+14155551237
```

### Secondary Contact Variables
Add variables specific to secondary contacts:
```csv
phone_number,customer_name,secondary_phone_1,secondary_1_name,secondary_1_role
+14155551234,John Smith,+14155551235,Jane Smith,Decision Maker
```

### Contact Ordering
- **Primary contact:** Always called first
- **Secondary order:** Called in column order (secondary_phone_1, then secondary_phone_2, etc.)
- **Campaign coordination:** Respects campaign retry settings between contacts

## Large File Handling

### Background Processing
- **Automatic queuing:** Files over 1000 rows processed in background
- **Memory efficiency:** Streaming processing prevents timeouts
- **Progress tracking:** Real-time status updates
- **System performance:** No impact on platform performance during import

### Notification System
- **Email notifications:** Sent when import completes
- **Success summary:** Number of leads imported successfully
- **Error summary:** Count and details of failed rows
- **Download links:** Access to error reports and imported data

### Processing Time
- **Small files (< 100 rows):** Usually complete within 1 minute
- **Medium files (100-1000 rows):** 2-5 minutes typical
- **Large files (1000+ rows):** 10-30 minutes depending on complexity
- **Very large files (10k+ rows):** May take several hours

## Best Practices

- **Use sample file:** Download provided template for correct format
- **Phone format:** International format without separators (+1234567890)
- **Clean data:** Remove empty rows and validate content
- **Test first:** Start with small batch to verify format
- **Match variables:** Ensure columns align with assistant configuration
