Knowledge bases enable your AI assistant to access and reference custom information from various sources like websites, documents, and files. This powerful feature allows your assistant to provide accurate, context-specific responses based on your own content.

## Approaches for Knowledge Integration

### 1. Copy-Paste into Prompt

- **Pros**: Quick to set up, immediate availability.
- **Cons**: Large texts can slow down responses or risk partial "hallucination."
- **Usage**: Useful for short references, like top 10 FAQs.

### 2. Knowledge Base Feature

Our dedicated Knowledge Base feature allows you to store and manage documents that the AI can query on demand:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Website Content" icon="globe">
    **Scrape entire websites** to capture all available information
    - Company websites
    - Product documentation
    - FAQ pages
    - Blog content
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Document Files" icon="file">
    **Upload various file formats** with your information
    - **PDF files:** Manuals, guides, reports
    - **Word documents (.docx):** Policies, procedures
    - **Text files (.txt):** Simple content, notes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Processing Status

Every knowledge base goes through different processing stages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Empty" icon="folder-open">
    No documents added yet. Add content to activate the knowledge base.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Processing" icon="clock">
    Documents are being analyzed and indexed. Processing time varies by content size.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Active" icon="check">
    Knowledge base is ready. Your AI assistant can now search and reference this information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Failed" icon="x">
    Processing failed. Common causes: protected websites, inaccessible content, corrupted files.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Integration Modes

Choose how your AI assistant accesses knowledge base information:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Function Call" icon="function">
    **Recommended:** Searches only when needed. More efficient and faster.
    
    **Best for:** General conversations
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Prompt Injection" icon="syringe">
    **Comprehensive:** Searches after every customer message. More accurate but slower.
    
    **Best for:** Support-focused assistants. Use with [filler audio](/ai-assistants/filler-audio)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

- Keep info concise, use bullet points.
- Separate topics with clear headings so the AI can parse more effectively.
- Monitor call transcripts to confirm the AI references your data correctly.
- Use publicly accessible URLs for website scraping
- Consider file size and processing time for large documents

## Website Scraping Considerations

<Warning>
**Website Protection:** Some websites have anti-scraping protection that can cause processing to fail. If you own the website, temporarily disable protection during scraping.
</Warning>

**Common issues:**
- Cloudflare protection, rate limiting, login requirements
- JavaScript-heavy sites, protected content

**Solutions:**
- Use publicly accessible URLs
- Export content manually and upload as documents
- Contact support for protected content assistance

## Setup Process

1. Navigate to Knowledge Bases in your dashboard
2. Click "Create Knowledge Base"
3. Add name and description
4. Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) or add website URLs
5. Wait for processing to complete
6. Assign to your assistant in [Assistant Settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#knowledge-base)

## Usage

Once connected, your assistant automatically searches the knowledge base during conversations to provide accurate, informed responses based on your content.

**Search functionality:** The AI searches through all documents in your knowledge base to find relevant information based on the customer's question and provides context-aware responses.

## Troubleshooting

**Processing fails:** Check if URLs are publicly accessible, disable website protection if you own it
**No search results:** Verify content relevance, ensure processing is complete (Active status)
**Slow responses:** Switch from Prompt Injection to Function Call mode
